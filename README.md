# Data-structure-Doubly-linked-list-calculator-for-large-numbers-


The project is a C program developed for the Data Struture course, designed to handle arithmetic operations on extremely large integers that surpass the capacity of standard data types. By utilizing doubly linked lists, the program effectively avoids overflow issues commonly encountered with floating-point representations in computer arithmetic.
